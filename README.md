### Project Idea Guidance

Nearly all of the web applications you interact with on a daily basis would do for this project: they are "full-stack" CRUD apps, that is. How to spot a CRUD app: if a website has users that log in, it is a CRUD app!

#### Do Not Do

Easiest is to list applications that aren't CRUD apps:

- ***games***
- artistic sites that focus on rich interaction
- aggregators that get data not from users, but from other web services (like Yahoo)
- real-time interactive applications, like chat apps (Slack)

Finally, there are types of CRUD apps that don't do well as projects:

- storefronts: these are technically CRUD apps. However, they involve complex use of web services that we will explore in the next project - save your effort for then!

#### Good Examples

So much of the Internet is CRUD apps!

- Social media:
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  - Tumblr
  - LinkedIn
  - Reddit
- Organizational, Business or ERP apps:
  - Todoist
  - Quicken
  - Salesforce
  - [Connect](http://www.getconnectapp.com)
- Services:
  - YouTube
  - Tinder
  - IMDB
  - StackOverflow
  - Uber
  - Yelp
  - FourSquare

You can make a clone of any of these (but not straight from a tutorial!), or something that performs a
service like these, or something else entirely!

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

- __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

- __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

- __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Is your code commented well enough for another developer to reason about your code easily?

- __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

- __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

  | Score | Expectations                                         |
  | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | **1** | _Does not meet expectations._                        |
  | **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_                     |
  | **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

  This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
